For secure communication, a vehicle needs to have an X.509 certificate and it needs to trust the device gateway’s X.509 certificate. (Each account has its own unique device gateway, and that certificate is included in the credentials.zip and baked into the image as a pinned CA when you bitbake.) The device gateway trusts a vehicle’s X.509 certificate if and only if that certificate is signed by what we call the fleet root certificate authority (CA). Every device, regardless of how it is initially provisioned, ends up with its own unique X.509 certificate signed by the fleet root CA. Whenever the device interacts with the OTA Connect server, the device gateway authenticates and identifies it by its X.509 certificate.
The provisioning process ensures that a signed certificate is associated with each device. This process is crucial for securing communication between devices and the OTA Connect server.
OTA Connect supports two provisioning methods. We refer to these two methods as "provisioning with shared credentials" and "provisioning with device credentials".


Note that in both cases, the server must have access to the fleet root CA for your fleet. The fleet root CA is used to sign identity metadata of thclconnected devices.

Let's take a closer look at how each method works.


. *Provisioning with shared credentials*

This type of provisioning is great for testing because the OTA Connect server manages the certificates and keys of the device. You can try out OTA Connect without involving the rest of your infrastructure. However, this method is not secure enough for a production scenario.

In shared credential provisioning, the OTA Connect server creates the fleet root CA for you, and stores the private key for the CA in a Vault. You include a provisioning key for the device in the image — the “shared credential”.

In this method, the following steps occur:

* You should download your initial provisioning key from your OTA Connect account, and bake it into the image for the device.
* The first time the device comes online, it connects to the device gateway and says, “Hi, I’m a new device, and I don’t have a TLS certificate yet. Here’s my provisioning key.”
* Then, our crypto service generates a new keypair and X.509 certificate for the device, signs that certificate with the private fleet root CA in the Vault instance, and sends the whole bundle to the vehicle.
* Then it deletes the vehicle’s private key.

This entire transaction is secured with TLS, using the pinned device gateway certificate provisioned in the image.

. *Provisioning with device credentials*

If you're using OTA Connect in production, you should provision with device credentials.
In this method there is no shared credential. Instead the following steps occur:

* You provide us with your own fleet root CA’s certificate (but NOT the private key).
* Then, you make sure that each device acquires, in some out-of-band process, an X.509 certificate signed by your fleet root CA. In an ideal world, you would generate a keypair and a self-signed X.509 certificate inside an HSM on the device (so that there’s never any private key material outside of the HSM), then submit a CSR for that self-signed device certificate using your own existing PKI (e.g. via PKCS#10), and an authentication method of your choosing. (In an automotive OEM context, for example, that might be a private server inside the factory infrastructure, using the physical location and an airgapped network as ways to authenticate the request’s validity.)
* Once the device has its signed certificate, it can register with the OTA Connect server: we simply verify that your fleet root CA has signed the vehicle certificate, and use the CNI on the vehicle certificate to identify it. If a device with that name already exists, it’s a normal update transaction; If not, we register it as a new vehicle.

Note that nowhere in this process have we had to use a shared credential, nor has any private key material existed outside of the vehicle (for vehicle keys), or your own PKI (for the fleet root CA). We have also used mutual TLS for transport security right from the beginning. This is why we describe this process as the more secure option.


With "shared credential" provisioning, devices are identified by the provisioning key. The role of the OTA server is to generate a keypair and an X.509 certificate, and sign off with the fleet root CA.
With "device credential" provisioning, you decide how devices are identified. You provide the OTA server with only your fleet root CA and ensure your devices already have an X.509 certificate signed by your fleet root CA.


== Setting up the OTA Connect Server for Provisioning

If you want to use "shared credential" provisioning, we'll generate a fleet root CA and keypair for you and store them on the OTA Connect server. We take the security of these keys and certificates extremely seriously: following industry best practices, they are kept in a Vault instance and only taken out when you request them.
If you want to use "device credential" provisioning, you'll need to provide us with your own fleet root CA so that the OTA Connect server can verify devices.
Of course, you can use both methods, but in that case, we recommend that you maintain separate user accounts:

* one account for testing with "shared credential" provisioning
* one account for production with "device credential" provisioning

Migrating devices from a test account to a production account is an extremely complex process and should be avoided.  Instead, we recommend that you test with devices that will not go into production or devices that can be completely reset for production.
Once you are ready for production, you should use your production account, your own fleet root certificate, and production devices that have their device certificates preinstalled.
